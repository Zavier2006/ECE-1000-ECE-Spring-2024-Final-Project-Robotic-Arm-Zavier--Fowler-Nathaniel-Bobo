# Robotic Arm
This GitHub cotains all relevant files used during development of our Robotic arm for our project fro ECE 1000
# Project Summary
Industrial and research settings often require precise and repetitive manipulation tasks, which can pose challenges for human operators. Prolonged manual operation can lead to fatigue, inefficiency, and errors in high-precision tasks. Through the use of robotics, such tasks become a lot easier, and the product has greater consistancy. This project will focus on the designing, fabricating, and programming of a robotic arm that can move within 180 degrees of motion up, down, left, and right and open/close. The final product will be a standard robotic arm prototype equipped with 3 servos and 2 joysticks. It will feature a basic set up along with a fundemental code that is the bases of most robotics. The system will aim for finding fuctionallity usingthe least amount of servos as well as, using the most basic understanding of circuits and code to create a fully fuctional arm.
# Project Capabilities
The arm can turn 180 degrees, raise 180 degrees, and the hand can open and close, but due to the materials used, it cannot sustain much weight
