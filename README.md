# Robotic Arm
This GitHub cotains all relevant files used during development of our Robotic arm for our project fro ECE 1000
# Project Summary
Industrial and research settings often require precise and repetitive manipulation tasks, which can pose challenges for human operators. Prolonged manual operation can lead to fatigue, inefficiency, and even errors in high-precision tasks. With the gift of robotics such task become a lot easier. This project will focus on the fundemental design, fabrication, and programming of a robotic arm that. The final product will be a standard robotic arm prototype equipped with 3 servos adn 1 Joystick. It will feature a basic set up along with a fundemental code that is the bases of most robotics. The system will aim for finding fuctionallity usingthe least amount of servos as well as, using the most basic uderstanding of Circuits and Code to create a fully fuctional arm.
